# Security Compliance Guide

This guide outlines the security compliance measures implemented in the DIVE25 Document Access System. It covers security controls, compliance frameworks, audit procedures, and security configuration guidelines.

## Security Framework

The DIVE25 system implements a comprehensive security framework based on the following principles:

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
2. **Least Privilege**: Minimal access rights for users and components
3. **Zero Trust**: No implicit trust regardless of network location
4. **Secure by Design**: Security built into architecture from the ground up
5. **Continuous Verification**: Ongoing monitoring and testing

## Compliance Standards

The DIVE25 system is designed to comply with the following standards:

| Standard | Description | Applicability |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| ISO/IEC 27001 | Information security management | Core framework |
| NIST SP 800-53 | Security controls for federal systems | Control implementation |
| GDPR | European data protection regulation | Personal data handling |
| HIPAA | US healthcare data privacy | Medical document handling |
| NATO Security Standards | Alliance security requirements | Military information |
| Common Criteria EAL4+ | Security evaluation | System certification |

## Security Controls

### Access Control

#### Authentication

The system implements multi-factor authentication with:

1. **Primary Authentication Methods**:
   - Username/password with complexity requirements
   - X.509 certificate-based authentication
   - Smart card/CAC card integration
   - Biometric authentication (where available)

2. **Secondary Authentication Factors**:
   - Time-based one-time passwords (TOTP)
   - Hardware security keys (FIDO2/WebAuthn)
   - SMS verification codes
   - Email verification links

3. **Authentication Policies**:
   - Failed login attempt limitations (3 attempts)
   - Account lockout procedures
   - Password expiration (90 days)
   - Password history enforcement (24 passwords)
   - Minimum password age (1 day)

#### Authorization

The system implements Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) with:

1. **Authorization Factors**:
   - User attributes (clearance level, role, organization)
   - Resource attributes (classification, compartment, owner)
   - Environmental attributes (time, location, device)
   - Action attributes (read, write, delete, share)

2. **Policy Enforcement Points**:
   - API Gateway layer
   - Service layer
   - Data access layer
   - User interface

3. **Policy Decision Points**:
   - Centralized policy service using Open Policy Agent
   - Real-time policy evaluation
   - Policy caching for performance
   - Policy auditing and logging

Example ABAC policy (in Rego):

```rego
package dive25.document.access

import data.users
import data.documents

default allow = false

# Allow access if user has appropriate clearance for document classification
allow {
    # Get user attributes
    user := users[input.user_id]
    
    # Get document attributes
    document := documents[input.document_id]
    
    # Check user clearance level against document classification
    clearance_levels := {
        "UNCLASSIFIED": 0,
        "RESTRICTED": 1,
        "CONFIDENTIAL": 2,
        "SECRET": 3,
        "TOP_SECRET": 4
    }
    
    # User clearance must be greater than or equal to document classification
    clearance_levels[user.clearance] >= clearance_levels[document.classification]
    
    # Additional checks for specific compartments
    check_compartments(user, document)
}

# Helper function to check compartment access
check_compartments(user, document) {
    # If document has compartments, user must have all of them
    count(document.compartments) > 0
    
    # All document compartments must be in user compartments
    compartment := document.compartments[_]
    compartment in user.compartments
}

# Special case: document owners can always access their documents
allow {
    document := documents[input.document_id]
    document.owner_id == input.user_id
}
```

### Encryption

#### Data at Rest

1. **Storage Encryption**:
